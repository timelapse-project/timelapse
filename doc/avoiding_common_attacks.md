# Avoiding Common Attacks

Here are the measures we have taken to make our smart-contracts as resistant as possible to common attacks and potential hacks.

## Re-Entrancy

Not applicable because we don't call any unknow contracts/addresses.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/re-entrancy)

## Arithmetic Overflow and Underflow

We use [Solidity 0.8.6](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/080-breaking-changes.html) that handles this problematic natively so, we don't need to use `SaFeMath` from _@openzeppelin_.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/overflow)

## Self Destruct

Not applicable because we don't handle any value (ETH).

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/self-destruct)

## Accessing Private Data

Thanks to Timelapse solution architecture, we do not store/handle any sensitive data of the customer in order to avoid malicious users to use private data (and be GDPR compliant).

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/accessing-private-data)

## Delegatecall

Not applicable because we don't need to use any delegate calls.

## Source of Randomness

Thanks to Timelapse solution architecture, we don't use any source of randomness.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/randomness)

## Denial of Service (revert)

Not applicable because we don't handle any value (ETH) and because we don't call any unknow contracts/addresses.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/denial-of-service)

## Denial of Service (Block Gas Limit)

Not applicable because we don't call any unknow contracts/addresses and we don't loop unlimited array (instead, we access array values via indexes, stored in mappings) except on the Proposal array (Offering). This exception is mitigated because, functionally, the number of proposals will never be high.

[Reference](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/#dos-with-block-gas-limit)

## Phishing with tx.origin

We do not use `tx.origin` in our contracts but only `msg.sender`(via Ownable from _@openzeppelin_).

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/phishing-with-tx-origin)

## Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract

The addresses of the 2 sub-contracts are public so that the code of these contracts can be checked and reviewed.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/hiding-malicious-code-with-external-contract)

## Honeypot

Not applicable (See [Re-Entrancy](#re-entrancy) and [Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract](#hiding-malicious-code-with-external-contract))

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/honeypot)

## Front Running

Front running can be used (or at least, will be useless) because all functions that can impact (update) the smart contracts are protected by Ownable from _@openzeppelin_.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/front-running)

## Block Timestamp Manipulation

Thanks to Timelapse solution architecture, `block.timestamp` is only used to log the timestamp of some actions (for logging/auditing purpose). As result, variation of +/- 15 seconds of `block.timestamp` has no impact on the behaviour of the solution.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/block-timestamp-manipulation)

## Signature Replay

Not applicable because we don't use off-chain signing messages.

[Reference](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/signature-replay)

## Bypass Contract Size Check

Not applicable because we don't need to test if `msg.sender` is a contract or not.
